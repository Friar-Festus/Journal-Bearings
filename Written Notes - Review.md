From notes for 1998 year-end letter:

*No xmas letter, New Year's due to sales cycle.*

*January
- *Tom - Spent most of the month in PA getting trained on new equipment that his unit has yet to see. During this time, made trip back home to NY. 
- *Serena - Went back to taking tap. First tap "workshop" ever. Later on, went to Cazadero Dance Camp, her first camp experience.*

*March
- *Tom - New Orleans for SelRes training. Saw Robin.*

*April*
- *Tom - ILSMT in SC.*
- *Golden Circle - lived like rich people for four days.*

*June*
- *Tom - Chile. time on CS Cochrane.*

*July*
- *Tom - RIMPAC in HI.*

*August*
- *Serena - At dance camp.*
- *Tom's unit moves to Point Mugu.*
*September*
- *Home to NY for Aunt Bunny's funeral. Showed Serena around Walden. Also went through Saratoga.*

*Novenber*
- *Volunteer work at Caz Dance Camp. Got to use jackhammer.*
- *Thanksgiving @ Disneyland.*
- *Fosse dance show.*

*December*
- *Serena's been exercising every day for over a year.*
- *LJ stayed @ house while awaiting closure on hers.*
- *Stomp for New Year's Eve.*

*First of all, we must apologize for not getting this letter out earlier. IBM runs on a calendar year, which puts the end of year sales crunch right into the holidays, and leaves little to no time for personal pursuits. But as they say, "better late than never."*

*The year began with Tom in PA for most of January, getting trained on equipment that his unit has yet to see. He's been using the f-word a lot this year (funding), most often preceded by "lack of". Frustrating business, the "modern" military.*

### Power & Desalination Scheme

This was written during a trip to Palo Alto, either when dropping G off for her summer at Stanford, or during a weekend in the middle when we went to visit and attend the Supertramp/Loverboy/Styx concert.

*Trying to think about this without inner critic getting in the way. I realize this would be a huge undertaking at the scale needed to make any impact on fresh water stores. Physical resource constraints are real but fiscal constraints are artificial.*

*Another big endeavor - tunnel from ocean to refill Great Salt Lake. Altitude difference? Salinity difference? Desalination from lake once levels restored.*

And that was as far as I got. Normally I date these types of notes.
